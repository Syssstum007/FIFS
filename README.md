## 🏆 About the Competition

The **FIFS Sports Data Gameathon** is a cutting-edge initiative to engage India’s top technological minds in crafting AI/ML-powered solutions for the Fantasy Sports ecosystem. Participants are challenged to use historical and live sports data to create models that can enhance prediction accuracy, strategic team selection, and user engagement throughout a fantasy league season.

---

## 🚀 Project Objective

The primary objective of this project is to **design and implement a robust AI/ML pipeline** that can:

- 🏏 Predict player performance based on historical data and recent form.
- 📊 Optimize fantasy team selection for maximum points under realistic constraints.
- 🔄 Adapt dynamically across matchdays, player injuries, and changing team combinations.
- 💡 Provide explainable insights to justify predictions and selections.

---

## 📊 Key Features

- ✅ **Data Ingestion**: Clean and preprocess raw match and player datasets.
- 🤖 **Modeling**: Use machine learning models (regression, classification, and ensemble techniques) to predict future performance.
- 🧮 **Fantasy Scoring System Integration**: Map predicted performance to fantasy point systems.
- ⚙️ **Dynamic Strategy Engine**: Optimize team selection using performance forecasts, budget constraints, and playing probabilities.
- 📉 **Evaluation Metrics**: Assess model accuracy using RMSE, MAPE, and cumulative fantasy points.
